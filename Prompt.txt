Perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset.

### Input:
- A tabular dataset with structured columns (like a DataFrame).
- Each column may be numeric, categorical, or datetime.
- The dataset may include a target column, which should be automatically detected or inferred if not specified.

### Objectives:
Generate:
1. An **EDA Report**: Detailed insights and observations sectioned clearly.
2. An **EDA Summary**: Concise, high-level summary of findings.
3. **Feature Engineering Suggestions**: List possible transformations, encodings, or new features that can improve modeling.
4. **Modeling Recommendations**: Based on EDA findings, suggest appropriate model types (e.g., regression/classification), feature selection strategies, or preprocessing steps.

### EDA Report must include:
- Shape of the dataset (rows, columns)
- Data types of each column
- Missing values (count and %)
- Duplicate rows (count)
- Univariate analysis (distribution of each feature)
- Bivariate analysis (relationships with target, if present)
- Correlation matrix (numerical features)
- Outlier detection (IQR or z-score)
- Basic statistics (mean, std, min, max, median)
- Any unusual patterns or anomalies

### EDA Summary must include:
- High-level patterns or concerns
- Key variables of interest
- Insights about data quality

### Feature Engineering Suggestions:
- Identify columns suitable for encoding (e.g., one-hot, label)
- Identify columns suitable for binning (e.g., age groups)
- Suggest new features (e.g., ratios, interaction terms)
- Flag redundant or low-variance features

### Modeling Suggestions:
- Classification or regression?
- Feature selection tips
- Recommended preprocessing (scaling, encoding, imputation)
- Potential target leakage risks

### Output:
Return everything in structured plain text or JSON. Visualizations are not required. Do not return code unless requested.

### Example Use Case:
The dataset contains: customer_id, age, gender, income, region, product_category, purchase_amount (target).
