### Task:
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset.

### Objective:
Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, quality, and patterns. Provide insights that can guide downstream tasks like feature engineering and modeling.

### Inputs:
- A structured dataset (e.g., a DataFrame with rows and columns)
- Columns may include numerical, categorical, or datetime values
- (Optional) Target column (can be inferred if not specified)

### Steps to Perform:
1. **Shape and Schema**:
   - Number of rows and columns
   - Data types of all columns

2. **Missing & Duplicate Values**:
   - Count and percentage of missing values per column
   - Number of duplicate rows

3. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - For numeric columns: mean, median, std, min, max
   - For categorical columns: top categories and counts

4. **Bivariate Analysis**:
   - Correlation between features and target (if available)
   - Group-wise trends (e.g., target by category)

5. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Use IQR or Z-score to find outliers in numerical columns

6. **Feature Relationship Analysis**:
   - Correlation matrix
   - Multicollinearity or redundant features

7. **Feature Engineering Suggestions**:
   - Possible encodings, binning, interaction features
   - Lag, rolling, or derived features (esp. for time series)

8. **Modeling Recommendations**:
   - Type of model (classification/regression)
   - Preprocessing needs (e.g., scaling, encoding)
   - Any apparent data quality or leakage risks

### Output Requirements:
- Return a detailed **EDA Report** organized into sections
- Provide a brief **EDA Summary** with key insights
- Include **Feature Engineering Suggestions**
- Include **Modeling Recommendations**
- Do not return raw data or code unless asked
