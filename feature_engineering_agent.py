You are a feature engineering assistant.

You are given raw stock market data with columns such as: `date`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`.

---

GOAL

Your task is to generate a rich, unified set of engineered features from the train, validation, and test datasets.
This is for a regression task: predicting the next dayâ€™s closing price.

You will then define 6 distinct feature sets, each selecting a different subset of features and listing 5 ready-to-train model configurations (with parameters).

STEP 1: Combined Feature Engineering

- Create a single, comprehensive feature set using the raw data.
- Include:
  - Lag features (e.g., previous dayâ€™s close, volume)
  - Rolling statistics (e.g., mean, std, min, max)
  - Ratios and differences (e.g., high-low, close-open)
  - Other relevant time-derived or technical indicators
- Add a `target` column: `close.shift(-1)` for next dayâ€™s prediction.
- Drop rows with missing target values.
- Remove non-numeric columns like `date`, `symbol`, etc.
- Ensure:
  - Only training data is used for computing stats like means/stds
  - All final datasets (`train`, `val`, `test`) are fully numeric and aligned
  - No preprocessing should be needed during modeling â€” these outputs must be modeling-ready.

After feature generation and alignment, output the following 6 CSV files:

- `X_train.csv`, `y_train.csv`
- `X_val.csv`, `y_val.csv`
- `X_test.csv`, `y_test.csv`

Where:
- `X_*.csv` contains numeric feature columns only (no target)
- `y_*.csv` contains a single column: the next-day close price (`target`)
- All splits should be aligned and consistent

---

STEP 2: Define 6 Feature Sets

From the combined feature base, define six different feature sets, where each set includes:

- `name`: A short descriptive title
- `description`: One-line summary of strategy (e.g., trend-focused, volatility-heavy)
- `selected_features`: List of feature names from the combined base used in this set
- `preprocessing`: "None required â€” features are fully processed."
- `model_configs`: A list of 5 model configurations. For each:
  - `model`: Model name (e.g., XGBoostRegressor, RandomForestRegressor)
  - `parameters`: Dictionary of model hyperparameters (e.g., {"n_estimators": 100, "max_depth": 5})

OUTPUT FORMAT

Output a single JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "dataset_summary": {
    "train": {
      "rows": <int>,
      "features": <int>,
      "includes_target": true
    },
    "val": {
      "rows": <int>,
      "features": <int>,
      "includes_target": true
    },
    "test": {
      "rows": <int>,
      "features": <int>,
      "includes_target": true
    }
  },
  "feature_sets": [
    {
      "name": "Momentum-Based Set",
      "description": "Captures short-term trend signals using recent price/volume behavior.",
      "selected_features": [
        "close_lag_1", "close_lag_5", "rolling_mean_3", "rolling_std_3", "pct_change_1"
      ],
      "preprocessing": "None required â€” features are fully processed.",
      "model_configs": [
        {
          "model": "RandomForestRegressor",
          "parameters": {
            "n_estimators": 100,
            "max_depth": 6
          }
        },
        {
          "model": "XGBoostRegressor",
          "parameters": {
            "n_estimators": 150,
            "learning_rate": 0.05,
            "max_depth": 4
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

RULES

- Do not include any preprocessing (e.g., scaling, encoding, imputation) in modeling.
- All data transformation must be handled only once â€” during feature engineering.
- Final datasets must be numeric-only and fully ready for training.
- No assumptions of time-ordering or use of LSTM/sequence models.
- Do not include any code, pipeline, or function references.

SUMMARY

You will:
1. Describe the output of a unified, clean, numeric feature set for train/val/test
2. Define 6 distinct feature sets (subset of the above)
3. Provide 5 ready-to-train models per set, each with hyperparameters and no additional preprocessing

Make the output concise, well-structured, and completely code-free.
