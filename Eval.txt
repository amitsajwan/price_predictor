### Task:
Evaluate a trained machine learning model on a test set.

### Objective:
Use appropriate regression metrics to evaluate a model trained to predict the **log of next-day stock returns**.

### Inputs:
- `X_test.csv`: Test set features
- `y_test.csv`: True log returns
- A trained regression model (already available)
- The task type is regression

### Steps to Perform:
1. Predict values (`y_pred`) using the model on `X_test`.
2. Compare predictions with the true values (`y_test`).
3. Compute the following metric:
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

4. Optionally:
   - Back-transform log returns if needed
   - Comment on error distribution or bias

### Output Requirements:
- Report the RMSE value (rounded to 6 decimal places)
- Interpret whether the RMSE is good or bad in the context of return prediction
- Mention if predictions are biased (e.g., consistently underpredicting/overpredicting)
- Do not include raw data, plots, or code unless asked
- Return a concise **Evaluation Summary** followed by a short **Improvement Suggestion** if RMSE is high

### Context:
The model predicts **log-transformed next-day returns** for a stock and is intended for time-series financial prediction.
