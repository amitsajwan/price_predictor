### Task:
Evaluate the performance of a machine learning regression model.

### Objective:
Measure the model’s ability to predict the log of next-day stock returns using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

### Inputs Provided:
- `X_test.csv`: Test set features
- `y_test.csv`: True log returns for the test set
- A trained regression model (already loaded or available for use)

### What to Do:
1. Predict `y_pred` using the model on `X_test`.
2. Compare `y_pred` against `y_test`.
3. Compute the **RMSE** between them.

### Output Requirements:
- Report the RMSE value (rounded to 6 decimal places).
- Interpret whether the RMSE indicates good or poor predictive accuracy for log returns.
- Briefly describe if the model appears biased or underfitting based on this RMSE.
- Do **not** return raw data, plots, or code — just structured text insight.

### Context:
This model is designed to predict **log-transformed next-day returns** of a stock, and is intended for use in financial time-series forecasting.
