Here’s what EDA can and should suggest based on its findings:

📌 1. Which Features Are Informative
High correlation with target → consider keeping

No variation / low variance → consider dropping

Highly collinear pairs → keep only one

🛠️ FE Suggestion: Drop redundant features or apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)

📈 2. Feature Transformations
Skewed distributions → apply log or Box-Cox

Outliers → consider winsorization or clipping

Nonlinear patterns → try polynomial, interaction terms

🛠️ FE Suggestion: Add transformations or bucketed versions

📊 3. Time Series Properties
Stationarity → use differencing/log returns

Autocorrelation → add lag features

Seasonality → extract time-based features (e.g., day, month)

🛠️ FE Suggestion: Create lags, moving averages, calendar features

🤝 4. Potential Interactions
If RSI and volume both correlate moderately with the target,
EDA might reveal that their combination is stronger.

🛠️ FE Suggestion: Create interaction features like RSI × volume

⚠️ 5. Data Quality Issues
Missing values → need imputation

Duplicate rows

Date gaps (in time series)

🛠️ FE Suggestion: Impute, fill gaps, drop or flag anomalies

Edit
1. High correlation found between 1-day lag return and target → add `return_lag_1d` to features
2. RSI and volume individually show moderate predictive power → try `RSI * volume` interaction
3. Price is skewed → apply log transformation for modeling
4. Volume shows strong weekday effect → add `day_of_week` as categorical
5. Outliers in daily return → consider clipping to +/- 5%
